I NEED A VBA CODE THAT: 

INSIDE MY SHEET CALLED "+", WATCHES FOR CHANGES IN CELL I4 AND I6. 

CELL I4 CONTAINS A DROPDOWN WITH TWO OPTIONS: "Agregar" OR "Eliminar". 

**** IF I4 IS "Agregar" THEN: 
- SET H6 CONTENT TO "En" WITHOUT CHANGING ANY FORMAT. 
- CLEAR I6 CONTENT WITHOUT REMOVING DATA VALIDATION. 
- CLEAR I8 CONTENT AND REMOVE ANY DATA VALIDATION FROM IT. 
- REMOVE ANY SHAPE BUTTON LOCATED IN CELL H10. 
- CREATE SHAPE BUTTON IN CELL H10 WITH THE FOLLOWING DETAILS: 
Rounded Rectangle
Name: BTN_ADD_or_DEL_DV
Text: Agregar
Bold: msoTrue
Font Size: 10
Font Color: White
Fill Color: RGB(25, 107, 36)
Line Color: RGB(25, 107, 36)
Other: msoAnchorMiddle and msoAlignCenter

**** IF I4 IS "Agregar" AND I6 IS "Categoría" THEN 
- FOR SHAPE LOCATED IN H10 SET .OnAction = Add_Category

**** IF I4 IS "Agregar" AND I6 IS "De" THEN 
- FOR SHAPE LOCATED IN H10 SET .OnAction = Add_De

**** IF I4 IS "Eliminar" THEN: 
- SET H6 CONTENT TO "De" WITHOUT CHANGING ANY FORMAT. 
- CLEAR I6 CONTENT WITHOUT REMOVING DATA VALIDATION. 
- CLEAR I8 CONTENT AND REMOVE ANY DATA VALIDATION FROM IT. 
- REMOVE ANY SHAPE BUTTON LOCATED IN CELL H10. 
- CREATE SHAPE BUTTON IN CELL H10 WITH THE FOLLOWING DETAILS: 
Rounded Rectangle
Name: BTN_ADD_or_DEL_DV
Text: Eliminar
Bold: msoTrue
Font Size: 10
Font Color: White
Fill Color: RGB(192, 0, 0)
Line Color: RGB(192, 0, 0)
Other: msoAnchorMiddle and msoAlignCenter

**** IF I4 IS "Eliminar" AND I6 IS "Categoría" THEN: 
- APPLY DATA VALIDATION DROPDOWN LIST TO CELL I8. 
- THE DROPDOWN MUST CONTAIN THE DATA BODY OF TABLE "DATA_BANK_CATEGORY".
- FOR SHAPE LOCATED IN H10 SET .OnAction = Del_Category

**** IF I4 IS "Eliminar" AND I6 IS "De" THEN: 
- APPLY DATA VALIDATION DROPDOWN LIST TO CELL I8. 
- THE DROPDOWN MUST CONTAIN THE DATA BODY OF TABLE "DATA_BANK_DE".
- FOR SHAPE LOCATED IN H10 SET .OnAction = Del_De 

**** IF I4 GETS CLEARED THEN: 
- CLEAR I6 AND I8. 
- REMOVE ANY DATA VALIDATION LOCATED IN CELL I8. 

**** IF I6 GETS CLEARED THEN:
- CLEAR I8. 
- REMOVE ANY DATA VALIDATION LOCATED IN CELL I8. 



NOW, PLEASE ALSO HELP BE TO BUILD Add_Category()
WHEN USER CLICKS ON SHAPE BUTTON LOCATED IN H10, IF I4 IS "Agregar", IF I6 IS "Categoría" AND I8 IS NOT EMPTY, THEN: 
- READ VALUE FROM I8. 
- IF VALUE FROM I8 DOES NOT EXIST IN THE DATA BODY OF TABLE "DATA_BANK_CATEGORY" THEN ADD THIS VALUE TO THAT TABLE IN THE LAST ROW. 
- BEFORE ADDING, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO USE PROPER CAPITALIZATION. 
- AFTER ADDING VALUE TO TABLE: 
FOR EVERY EXISTING SHEET NAMED OTHER THAN "+", "Data" OR "HOME": 
(*) Call Set_MainTable(ws) to get the Main Table Name. 
(*) SearcH for Table named MainTable (public String). 
(*) In column "CATEGORÍA" of that table, update the data validation dropdown to the data body of table "DATA_BANK_CATEGORY" WITHOUT removing current cell contents. 

NOW, PLEASE ALSO HELP BE TO BUILD Add_De()
WHEN USER CLICKS ON SHAPE BUTTON LOCATED IN H10, IF I4 IS "Agregar", IF I6 IS "De" AND I8 IS NOT EMPTY, THEN: 
- READ VALUE FROM I8. 
- IF VALUE FROM I8 DOES NOT EXIST IN THE DATA BODY OF TABLE "DATA_BANK_DE" THEN ADD THIS VALUE TO THAT TABLE IN THE LAST ROW. 
- BEFORE ADDING, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO USE PROPER CAPITALIZATION. 
- AFTER ADDING VALUE TO TABLE: 
FOR EVERY EXISTING SHEET NAMED OTHER THAN "+", "Data" OR "HOME": 
(*) Call Set_MainTable(ws) to get the Main Table Name. 
(*) Search for Table named MainTable (public String). 
(*) In column "DE" of that table, update the data validation dropdown to the data body of table "DATA_BANK_DE" WITHOUT removing current cell contents. 

NOW, PLEASE ALSO HELP BE TO BUILD Del_Category()
WHEN USER CLICKS ON SHAPE BUTTON LOCATED IN H10, IF I4 IS "Eliminar", IF I6 IS "Categoría" AND I8 IS NOT EMPTY, THEN:
- READ VALUE FROM I8. 
- IF VALUE FROM I8 EXISTS IN THE DATA BODY OF TABLE "DATA_BANK_CATEGORY" THEN REMOVE TABLE ROW THAT CONTAINS THAT VALUE. 
FOR EVERY EXISTING SHEET NAMED OTHER THAN "+", "Data" OR "HOME": 
(*) Call Set_MainTable(ws) to get the Main Table Name. 
(*) Search for Table named MainTable (public String). 
(*) In column "CATEGORÍA" of that table, update the data validation dropdown to the data body of table "DATA_BANK_CATEGORY" WITHOUT removing current cell contents. 

NOW, PLEASE ALSO HELP BE TO BUILD De()
WHEN USER CLICKS ON SHAPE BUTTON LOCATED IN H10, IF I4 IS "Eliminar", IF I6 IS "De" AND I8 IS NOT EMPTY, THEN:
- READ VALUE FROM I8. 
- IF VALUE FROM I8 EXISTS IN THE DATA BODY OF TABLE "DATA_BANK_DE" THEN REMOVE TABLE ROW THAT CONTAINS THAT VALUE.
