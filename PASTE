Hi Christine! 
 
I got home after 6 pm, totally drained. Ash is doing fine, despite the fact that she stayed for the whole night at the Vet. She has also been neutered. I will keep you updated about her post. 
 
Thank you for remaining attentive and for your comprehension. We can schedule some extra hours for next week, so I can make up for that time. 
 
As for today, it is a holiday here in Argentina. I just wanted to let you know that I am here if you or the team need assistance.
