Hi Christine,

I got home after 6 p.m., completely drained. Ash is doing fine, despite having spent the entire night at the vet. She’s also been neutered. I’ll keep you updated on her recovery.

Thank you for staying attentive and for your understanding. We can schedule some extra hours next week so I can make up for the time.

As for today, it’s a holiday here in Argentina, but I just wanted to let you know that I’m available if you or the team need any assistance.
