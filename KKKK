Hi John,

Thank you for meeting with us today. As I explained during our call, this is a recap of our 1-1 to ensure we are on the same page. 


•	We discussed my observations of your performance over the past month and a half.
    - There have been times when you haven’t met due dates, missed Triage team meetings where important discussions were taking place, and seemed unprepared to fulfill job responsibilities which resulted in hardship for our team. Additionally, because you are still learning, you do not have the same amount of responsibilities as the rest of the team so when you aren’t able to meet deadlines, it leads me to wonder what is filling your time. 
•	I shared the following examples:
•	You missed the 10/29 Triage meeting where the team was coordinating shakeout validation for 10/31. You didn’t communicate that you would miss the meeting or follow-up to determine what was missed. As a result, when you went into shakeout on 10/31, you did not seem prepared. Linda ended up completing the 2nd story instead of sharing the responsibility between the two of you.
•	Jenn set a due date of 10/31 to complete your rating audit and asked several times throughout the week if you needed help. Jenn reached out to you again on 10/31 and you said you planned to finish the audit that evening. You did not finish the audit on 10/31 or let her know it wasn’t done, which resulted in her needing to reach out to you on Monday. You completed the audit halfway through your work day on 11/3.
•	You mentioned that you are in 2 or 3 hours of meetings per day which can make it challenging to complete your job duties, but I reminded you that if that is the case, you would still have 5 hours left to complete tasks. If for some reason this time is not enough, you should discuss this with me in our weekly 1-1’s when I ask what support you need from me. 
•	You mentioned that you were initially feeling uncomfortable with rating audits, but now you feel much better and are confident you can meet the established deadlines while also taking on more work. I asked you to focus on completing your assigned tasks first, but if they are completed on time and with quality, it would be great if you could ask for more work or offer your support to the rest of the team. 
•	Luiz asked you to let us know the next due date you have coming up and if you feel comfortable completing the work and meeting the deadline. 
•	You shared you are working on a clean-up with some of your peers that should be finished by the end of this week, and you feel comfortable with the steps you need to take (specific dates outlined under the expectations below).

•	These are my expectations for you in this role:
•	Attendance
•	You will be here on time for your scheduled shifts.
•	If you are going to be late, can’t work, or have to leave early, you will let me know and will provide any requested documentation within a few days of returning to work.
•	Work product/delivery
•	In addition to on-the-job training with your peers in Triage, you are responsible for completing the tasks below:
•	Clean-ups
•	Clean-ups are typically ad hoc requests where the actions needed will vary. You are currently working on a policy clean-up with some of your peers. The clean-up for each policy may take 2-3 days depending on the status. 
•	Day 1 – Void endorsements – due 11/5/2025
•	Day 2 – Backout/reissue – due 11/6/2025
•	Day 3 – Reapply endorsements (where needed) – due 11/7/2025
•	Rating audits
•	August rating audits - due 11/14/2025 at the latest
•	Michigan artisan contractor
•	Michigan manufacturing
•	September rating audits - due 12/5/2025 at the latest
•	Maryland retail/service
•	Maryland real estate
•	Missouri manufacturing
•	You will work on these audits consistently throughout the day and will not wait until the due date to complete them.
•	You should complete a minimum of one audit per week and when you finish your assigned audits, you will ask Jenn to assign you more. 
•	You will also meet the due dates for any audits assigned in the future.
•	Production validation
•	We have shakeouts every two weeks on Friday (the next one is on 11/14)
•	You will attend any Triage team discussions where the user stories are assigned out and will prepare for validation in advance so you are ready to complete your tasks on Friday morning. 
•	If you need assistance or if the completion of your tasks will take longer than your peers, you will let them know. 
•	Betse’s PTO coverage
•	On 11/7 and 11/11, you will check the SRM list for accounts that need to be added to the autopay rule workaround.
•	On 11/6, 11/10, and 11/12, you will run the failed e-sign report for accounts that need to be added to the autopay rule workaround (thank you for running the report today).
•	You will be responsible for your own work and will not allow your teammates to take on your tasks, even if they offer.
•	When you have time during the workday where you are not doing rating audits, prepping for production validation, or in a Triage team meeting, you should be filling your time with tasks that contribute to the success of our team.
•	This includes, but is not limited to, completing Triage tickets (those that you have the proper system access to handle) or asking your peers if there is any work you can take off their plates.
•	If you do not know what to do to fill your time, you will reach out to Jenn or I for additional assignments.
•	Your work product will be completed with quality, although we understand you are new to this role and may need to ask for help to deliver the expected results. 
•	Communication
•	If there is a task that you can’t do or that won’t be done on time for any reason, you will notify me in advance.
•	You should attend all scheduled Triage team meetings and if you have a conflict that will prevent you from being there, you will communicate this to myself and your peers. 
•	If you miss a meeting like this, you will proactively reach out to your team members to find out what you missed.
•	If you need help or have questions on any work task, you will reach out to myself, Jenn, or one of your peers for assistance. 

Please respond to this email confirming that you understand the expectations I have set for you. Please let me know if there is anything you need from me to assist you with being successful in this role. 

Thank you,
