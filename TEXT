I have a sheet called "GALICIA VISA".

I want the whole sheet to be protected this way:

(*) Rows belonging to Table named "Galicia_Visa": 
Columns B to G: unprotected
Column G: protected
Column I to J: unprotected

(*) Rows belonging to Table named "Galicia_Visa_2025"
Columns L to W: 
- If contains Checkbox: unprotected
- If does not contain Checkbox: protected

(*) Rows belonging to Table named "Galicia_Visa_2026"
Columns Y to AJ: 
- If contains Checkbox: unprotected
- If does not contain Checkbox: protected

IMPORTANT:

- The rest of the sheet must be protected. 
- User must be able only to select and edit contents of the unprotected cells. 
- Selection Box must be visible.
- Any format/change done via VBA internal code must be accepted. 
- For Tables ending in _2025 and _2026, please be aware that Checkboxes may appear or disappear based on some input values in Table Galicia_Visa. So the protection must be dynamic.
